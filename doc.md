Technical Specification: Comprehensive Relationship Needs Analysis System (CRNAS)1. AbstractThis document outlines the algorithmic architecture for a scientifically grounded relationship needs assessment tool. Unlike traditional "Love Language" models, CRNAS utilizes a multi-layered approach, integrating the Big Five (OCEAN) psychometric model, Self-Determination Theory (SDT), Attachment Theory, and the Dual Control Model of Sexual Response.The system is designed using a Composition over Inheritance principle. It treats a user profile not as a monolithic entity, but as a composition of independent, interacting modules (Components).2. Core Methodology & ArchitectureThe system operates on three distinct processing layers:The Substrate Layer (Hardware): Biological and stable psychological traits (Big Five, Neurotype).The Needs Layer (Interface): The S.R.M.E. model (Safety, Resource, Resonance, Expansion).The Context Layer (Implementation): Specific interests, values, and defense mechanisms.2.1. Compositional Structure (Data Entities)The UserProfile entity is composed of the following modules:PsychometricsComponent (The "Hardware")RelationalNeedsComponent (The S.R.M.E. Engine)ErosComponent (Sexual Temperament)ShadowComponent (Conflict & Attachment)ContextComponent (Interests & Values)3. Module Specifications & Variables3.1. Module A: PsychometricsComponent (The Hardware)Purpose: Acts as a coefficient modifier for all other modules. It represents the user's "operating system."Variables:O_score (Float 0.0-1.0): Openness. Correlates with Intellectual Resonance and Novelty needs.C_score (Float 0.0-1.0): Conscientiousness. Inverse correlation with external Resource/Scaffolding needs.E_score (Float 0.0-1.0): Extraversion. Correlates with Social Expansion needs.A_score (Float 0.0-1.0): Agreeableness. Correlates with Emotional Resonance needs.N_score (Float 0.0-1.0): Neuroticism. Strong correlation with Safety needs.Neurotype_Flags (Bitmask/Set):ADHD_Trait: Modifies Novelty decay rate (boredom) and Executive Function needs.ASD_Trait: Modifies Sensory Safety needs and Communication directness.3.2. Module B: RelationalNeedsComponent (The S.R.M.E. Model)Purpose: Defines the core interaction style the user requires.Dimensions:Safety (S): Need for regulation, predictability, and anxiety reduction.Resource (R): Need for instrumental support, acts of service, and logistical scaffolding.Resonance (M): Need for shared meaning, cognitive or emotional synchronization.Expansion (E): Need for novelty, autonomy, and personal growth facilitation.Variables per Dimension:raw_score (Float): Self-reported importance.calculated_weight (Float): The final importance score after Big Five adjustment.preferred_channel (Enum): The mode of delivery (e.g., Verbal, Physical, Action-based).3.3. Module C: ErosComponent (Sexual Profile)Methodology: Based on the Dual Control Model (Nagoski).Variables:accelerator_sensitivity (Float): Ease of arousal.brake_sensitivity (Float): Susceptibility to inhibition (stress, environment).context_dependency (Enum): High (needs specific conditions) vs Low (spontaneous).erotic_language (List<Tags>): Specific pathways to arousal (e.g., Sapiosexual, Kinky, Sensory, Devotional).3.4. Module D: ShadowComponent (Defense & Trauma)Methodology: Attachment Theory & Gottman Conflict Styles.Variables:attachment_style (Enum): Secure, Anxious, Avoidant, Disorganized.conflict_response (Enum): Fight (Attack), Flight (Withdraw), Freeze (Shut down), Fawn (Appease).regulation_method (Enum): Co-regulation (needs partner) vs Auto-regulation (needs solitude).4. Algorithmic Logic4.1. The Correction Algorithm (Normalization)User self-reporting is often inaccurate. We use the PsychometricsComponent to adjust the raw_score of needs.Pseudocode Logic:def calculate_safety_weight(raw_safety, big_five):
    # Neuroticism is the primary driver for Safety needs.
    # If N is high, Safety is critical regardless of what the user says.
    n_weight = 0.7
    base_safety = raw_safety * (1.0 - n_weight)
    implicit_safety = big_five.N_score * n_weight
    
    final_safety = base_safety + implicit_safety
    return clamp(final_safety, 0.0, 1.0)

def calculate_resource_weight(raw_resource, big_five, neurotype):
    # Low Conscientiousness or ADHD increases need for external scaffolding (Resource).
    dysfunction_penalty = (1.0 - big_five.C_score)
    
    if "ADHD" in neurotype:
        dysfunction_penalty += 0.2
        
    final_resource = max(raw_resource, dysfunction_penalty)
    return final_resource
4.2. The Context Interpretation AlgorithmThis algorithm maps Interests to Resonance Types based on Openness.Logic:Input: User Interest (e.g., "Programming") + Psychometrics.Process:IF Openness > 0.7 (High):Map "Programming" to Cognitive Resonance (Deep discussion, architecture analysis).IF Agreeableness > 0.7 AND Openness < 0.5:Map "Programming" to Emotional/Support Resonance (Empathizing with coding burnout, celebrating success).IF Conscientiousness > 0.7:Map "Programming" to Functional Resonance (Code reviews, productivity optimization).4.3. The Compatibility Heuristic (Scoring)Compatibility is not about identical scores, but about Need-Provision Fit.Formula:$$ Compatibility = \sum (UserA.Needs_i \times UserB.Capacity_i) \times Penalty(ShadowMismatch) $$Critical Mismatch Flags (Instant Fail Conditions):The Anxious-Avoidant Trap:UserA.Shadow.Attachment == Anxious AND UserB.Shadow.Attachment == Avoidant.Result: Severe Penalty.The Expansion-Safety Conflict:UserA.Needs.Expansion > 0.8 AND UserB.Psychometrics.Openness < 0.3.Result: UserA will bore UserB, UserB will constrain UserA.5. Survey Methodology (Input Strategy)To populate these components, the survey must use Scenario-Based Inquiries rather than declarative statements.Example Data Collection Pattern:Do not ask: "Do you like intellectual conversations?"Ask: "You and your partner disagree on a complex topic. What is your ideal outcome?"A) We drop it to keep the peace. (Maps to: Safety > Resonance)B) We debate until we find the logical truth, even if it gets heated. (Maps to: Resonance (Cognitive) > Safety)C) My partner listens to my feelings about the topic. (Maps to: Resonance (Emotional))6. Output Generation (The "User Manual")The final output is a structural directive, not a label.Output Object Structure:{
  "profile_summary": "High-Maintenance Cognitive Explorer",
  "drivers": {
    "primary": "Resonance (Intellectual)",
    "secondary": "Expansion (Novelty)"
  },
  "constraints": {
    "safety_mechanism": "Requires Logic-based Reassurance",
    "resource_dependency": "High (Executive Dysfunction detected)"
  },
  "erotic_key": "Sapiosexual / Context-Dependent",
  "shadow_warning": "Tendency to Intellectualize emotions (Avoidant-Dismissive)"
}
